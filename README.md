# Set-up instructions

## Front-end set-up:
* Go to github.com/iO-Academy
* Find the repository "music-player-fe" and clone it to your local device
* Navigate into the "music-player-fe" directory in the terminal
* Switch to story 1 branch by running "git checkout story-1" in the terminal
* Find the "src" file and go into "settings.js"
* Edit line 1 of the file so that it says: `const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:1234/23-mar-icantbelieveitsnotspotify/'`
* Run "npm install", "npm start" commands in the terminal to get the front-end app running on http://localhost:3000

## Back-end set-up:
* Clone the repository "23-mar-icantbelieveitsnotspotify" into your local device (also on github.com/iO-Academy).
* Create an SQL database and name it "musciplayer"
* In the "db" folder open "music.sql" and run all SQL commands to populate the database
* Navigate into the "23-mar-icantbelieveitsnotspotify" directory in the terminal
* Run "composer install" command

## Testing the product:
* To test the different stories make sure you are in that story branch in both "music-player-fe" and "23-mar-icantbelieveitsnotspotify" directories (story 2 branch named "story-2", story 3 branch named "story-3", etc.)
* Clear "musicplayer" database and re-run SQL commands if data is not displaying front-end
